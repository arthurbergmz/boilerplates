# Boilerplates

The definition of a boilerplate is a standardized piece of code that can be reused in a project. It is a template that can be used to create something new without having to start from scratch. Boilerplates are used to standardize the way a project is set up, so that all developers working on the project can follow the same conventions.

In this repository, you will find a collection of complete boilerplate projects that reflect my preferred conventions and setup. You can just  copy and paste a boilerplate folder to start a new project.
